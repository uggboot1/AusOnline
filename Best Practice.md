# Personal Cyber Security: Defenses and Best Practice

## Your Devices
It is extremely important to protect your personal computer and mobile phone. Remember that you will have many personal items such as digital photographs, documents, invoice and receipts, and other types of personal information on your device. If a bad guy gets physical access to your device, it's bad enough they have your personal data, but they may also be able to gather more information from your documents and expand to impact other aspects of your life, including theft, identity theft and fraud.
Always carry and store your devices thoughtfully. Never leave them unguarded, and don't use them in an unsafe environment where they may be snatched and stolen.
### Your phone
Modern smartphones are used in most areas of our lives, and have a huge amount of our data and access. We regularly use them to replace the physical version of wallets, id cards, house and car keys, cash, receipts, contact lists and document folers.
If you lose your phone, it may cause you a great deal of trouble, and if a bad guy gets physical access to your phone, they may be able to get unimpeded access to:
- personal photo albums
- digital payment cards
- social media and online communication to friends and colleagues
- employment related data and services
Here are some important mitigating strategies to reduce the risks associated with a lost phone.
#### Find my phone, also lock and wipe it
Iphones and Android phones both have technology available for your to track and locate a lost phone, but it must be set up when you first get your phone otherwise you won't be able to use it.  If you haven't set it up yet on your phone, do so as soon as possible, or seek out advice from a trusted expert.
When you lose your phone, time is critical to locate it, as once your phone battery goes flat, the phone can no longer send you location information. If the phone battery does go flat, the location system may retain the last known location of the device.
You can also choose to put the phone into a *lost mode* which will
- lock the phone and protect the information from curious people who find it.
 - They won't be able to use your phone, or access your private data.
- The screen can display your contact details so someone who finds it can return it to you.
- The phone will emit a noise to alert people close by that it is there.
- If in the device is recharged and powered back on at a later time, it will continue to alert and also update it's location to you. 
Note that if you ever disconnect the SIM card in the phone it will not be able to alert you of it's location in the future, but will remain locked and alerting with your contact details.
