# Personal Cyber Security: Threat, Defenses and Best Practice

## Your Devices
It is extremely important to protect your personal computer and mobile phone. Remember that you will have many personal items such as digital photographs, documents, invoice and receipts, and other types of personal information on your device. If a bad guy gets physical access to your device, it's bad enough they have your personal data, but they may also be able to gather more information from your documents and expand to impact other aspects of your life, including theft, identity theft and fraud.

Always carry and store your devices thoughtfully. Never leave them unguarded, and don't use them in an unsafe environment where they may be snatched and stolen.
### Your phone
Modern smartphones are used in most areas of our lives, and have a huge amount of our data and access. We regularly use them to replace the physical version of wallets, id cards, house and car keys, cash, receipts, contact lists and document folers.

If you lose your phone, it may cause you a great deal of trouble, and if a bad guy gets physical access to your phone, they may be able to get unimpeded access to:
- personal photo albums
- digital payment cards
- social media and online communication to friends and colleagues
- employment related data and services

Here are some important mitigating strategies to reduce the risks associated with a lost phone.

#### Automatic Updates for Android and iPhone
Regular, timely updates of your phone's software (Android, iPhone) is extremely important to protect your device and your data. Weaknesses in the security of all software are continuously being discovered, and Software vendors will produce regular software updates to fix and protect against cybercriminals using those weaknesses for their advantage.
- When your phone or tablet prompts you to update, ensure you perform the update as soon as possible
- Manually check for updates on occasion for your phone to ensure you receive them as soon as possible
- Avoid using old phones that no longer receive updates. Phone vendors can't support their devices forever, and they will eventually stop producing security updates.
- Also ensure your apps are up-to-date, as they might also carry risks if they remain unpatched.

#### Find my phone, also lock and wipe it
Iphones and Android phones both have technology available for your to track and locate a lost phone, but it must be set up when you first get your phone otherwise you won't be able to use it.  If you haven't set it up yet on your phone, do so as soon as possible, or seek out advice from a trusted expert.
When you lose your phone, time is critical to locate it, as once your phone battery goes flat, the phone can no longer send you location information. If the phone battery does go flat, the location system may retain the last known location of the device.

You can also choose to put the phone into a **lost mode** which will
- lock the phone and protect the information from curious people who find it.
  - They won't be able to use your phone, or access your private data.
- The screen can display your contact details so someone who finds it can return it to you.
- The phone will emit a noise to alert people close by that it is there.
- If in the device is recharged and powered back on at a later time, it will continue to alert and also update it's location to you. 

Note that if you ever disconnect the SIM card in the phone it will not be able to inform you of it's location in the future (should it be recharged and turned on), but will remain locked and alerting with your contact details.
#### Defend against Phone Porting
One method used by scammers is to trick your phone company into porting (transferring) your mobile phone number to them. Using this, they may be able to reset passwords and gain control of any accounts that rely on your phone number as an authentication device (eg to send you a code to verify it's really you trying to reset your password. If the scammer has your phone number, this could work).

Advice to prevent phone porting
- Set a secure password on your online account for your mobile phone
- keep your details up to date with your mobile phone company
- remove your personal and contact information from your social media and online pages
  - items such as date of birth and phone number will give the scammer information to port your number away
- Your mobile phone company may be able to set a PIN on your account. Remember and protect your PIN.

#### Be alert to SMS scams
SMS scams are where a scammer will send you an SMS message, to trick you into taking some action. The most obvious is smishing where an SMS message encourages you to tap a link in the message, and log in to your account (the system you log into is not genuine, and they will harvest your login and password to scam you. However Smishing could also be a conversation convincing you to buy send money or gift cards, invest money or disclose personal or banking details.

Here is some guidance on how to avoid SMS scams:
- Does the message have a link to tap on? If so, it may be a scam. Be extremely cautious.
- Is this really someone you know or trust? Would they ask you to send money via SMS? Or would they call you and explain?
- Beware a stranger that is trying to convince you to send money, gift cards, or invest in their scheme. Large returns or avoided penalties are a red flag.
- There is pressure to act ASAP to get a benefit or avoid a missed opportunity

#### Beware of QRishing (aka Quishing)
Since the pandemic, *QR codes* have become pervasive, and many payments and purchases now require a phone to read and follow a QR code to a payment portal. Cybercriminals are taking advantage of this, targeting the public with **QR** codes that direct you to **phishing** websites, trying to trick you into revealing our payment details or identity information. QR codes can be displayed in a variety of locations: sent to you through email, at the pay station of a parking garage, on a poster for a band performance, at the table of a cafe.

Bad QR codes can hard to spot, can evade email scanners, and could be affixed on top of genuine QR codes on signs and posters. Here are some strategies for avoiding QRishing scams:
- Directly navigate your browser to known domains and URLs rather than accepting the QR link
- Approach QR links with skepticism, and carefully consider the URL it is directing you to before following it. It is not possible to judge trustworthiness of QR codes on sight. Even safe QR codes can be convincingly replaced by scam QR codes.
- Search directly for your apps in the app store, and try to avoid installing apps from QR codes. Research, consider and install the apps you need in advance. Avoid rushed installs at the last minute if possible
- Search for known scams before considering a QR code.
- Educate yourself and your friends and family on the risks of QR codes.

#### Disposing of your phone
When you have a new phone, or are no longer using an old phone, you should take measures to safeguard the personal information stored on that phone.
- Copy off your photos, videos, documents, or anything else you want to keep from your phone
- Move your authenticators to your new phone
  - If you have set up authenticators for your online services (for 2-factor authentication via a code on your phone) you will need to move your authenticators onto your new phone. If you don't you may not be able to log in to your account.
- If your phone has a removable media slot, remove any memory cards from the phone
- Factory Reset your device to wipe all data from the phone
- Delete that phone from the trusted devices list of your cloud services 
  - For example, in your Google or Apple account, your cloud email, your streaming services etc


### Your computer
Your computer probably holds a rich collection of information about you, your family, your friends... your *life*. It may also contain information which belongs to your employer, your customers or your business. Because of this, your computer can be a significant target for cybercriminals and identity thieves. It is critical that you defend your computer at all levels, and take steps to protect the data that it holds. Remember that your computer is not just at risk from being online, but also physically at risk of damage and theft.

#### Automatic Updates
Regular, timely updates of your computer's software is extremely important to protect your system and your data. Weaknesses in the security of all software are continuously being discovered, and Software vendors will produce regular software updates to fix and protect against cybercriminals using those weaknesses for their advantage.
- Enable automatic updates of your software.
- When your system or applications prompt you to update, ensure you perform the update as soon as possible
- Manually check for updates on occasion for your operating system to ensure you receive them as soon as possible
- Avoid using software that is old and past it's support lifecycle. Vendors can't support their software forever, and they will eventually stop producing security updates. Ensure you are using current supported versions of your software. This includes your Windows and MacOS.

#### Malware Protection
In the early days of computers, viruses were mischievous, and their authors were often curious about what they could get their malware to do. However, modern malware has evolved into a sophisticated and pervasive threat, capable of causing significant harm to individuals, businesses, and even entire nations. In the modern digital age where cyber attacks are increasingly frequent and financially driven, antivirus software plays a critical role in defending against these malicious programs. Here are some guidelines for using antivirus software on your digital devices:
- Use a reputable brand of antivirus. When choosing which brand you will use, conduct your research on reputable websites and base your choice on articles from a trustworth source.
- Carefully install your Antivirus software, and ensure it is running in the background at the end of the installation. Reboot your computer after installation to assure yourself the antivirus software starts up automatically.
- Run an initial antivirus scan over your entire computer.
- Keep your Antivirus software up to date. This should be automatic and not require you to do this manually. The software will check in the background for any updates, and will download them automatically.
- Real-time or on-access scanning should be enabled if this is an option. The AV software will scan files as they are being accessed, rather than just running a weekly scan.
- Enable browsing options which will monitor the websites you are visiting, and block and alert you to any malicious pages you attempt to visit.
- Consider enabling firewall protection from the Antivirus software.



#### Strong Password and Disk Encryption
While your computer is sitting on your desk, at home or at work, your login password protects your data from casual unauthorized access. However, if your computer gets stolen or lost, disk encryption ensures that there is no way for your data to be read without your password, even by the best hacker.

Regarding complex passwords, we used to recommend using a long and complex password, as these are difficult for an attacker to guess. However, recent research and guidance from cybersecurity experts suggest that passphrases offer a more user-friendly alternative without compromising security. Passphrases, composed of multiple words or a sentence, are easier to remember while still providing strong protection against unauthorized access.

- Set a strong login password or passphrase for your computer. Although it is convenient to have no password for your computer, an intruder would be able to access your data as simply as you could. 
- Make sure your password/passphrase could not be guessed.
- Disk encryption protects your data, even if your computer is stolen. A thief will never be able to access your encrypted data without your password.


#### Backups
Personal computer backups are important for protecting your data from both accidental loss, and from cyber attackers. Your personal computer may be storing your family photos, personal financial records and critical business documents. It's also important to remember that the older your computer is, the more likely it is that the disk will fail. To ensure the safety and accessibility of your data, it's essential to implement best practices for data backups:
