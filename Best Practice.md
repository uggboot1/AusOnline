# Personal Cyber Security: Defenses and Best Practice

## Your Devices
It is extremely important to protect your personal computer and mobile phone. Remember that you will have many personal items such as digital photographs, documents, invoice and receipts, and other types of personal information on your device. If a bad guy gets physical access to your device, it's bad enough they have your personal data, but they may also be able to gather more information from your documents and expand to impact other aspects of your life, including theft, identity theft and fraud.

Always carry and store your devices thoughtfully. Never leave them unguarded, and don't use them in an unsafe environment where they may be snatched and stolen.
### Your phone
Modern smartphones are used in most areas of our lives, and have a huge amount of our data and access. We regularly use them to replace the physical version of wallets, id cards, house and car keys, cash, receipts, contact lists and document folers.

If you lose your phone, it may cause you a great deal of trouble, and if a bad guy gets physical access to your phone, they may be able to get unimpeded access to:
- personal photo albums
- digital payment cards
- social media and online communication to friends and colleagues
- employment related data and services

Here are some important mitigating strategies to reduce the risks associated with a lost phone.
#### Find my phone, also lock and wipe it
Iphones and Android phones both have technology available for your to track and locate a lost phone, but it must be set up when you first get your phone otherwise you won't be able to use it.  If you haven't set it up yet on your phone, do so as soon as possible, or seek out advice from a trusted expert.
When you lose your phone, time is critical to locate it, as once your phone battery goes flat, the phone can no longer send you location information. If the phone battery does go flat, the location system may retain the last known location of the device.

You can also choose to put the phone into a **lost mode** which will
- lock the phone and protect the information from curious people who find it.
 - They won't be able to use your phone, or access your private data.
- The screen can display your contact details so someone who finds it can return it to you.
- The phone will emit a noise to alert people close by that it is there.
- If in the device is recharged and powered back on at a later time, it will continue to alert and also update it's location to you. 

Note that if you ever disconnect the SIM card in the phone it will not be able to inform you of it's location in the future (should it be recharged and turned on), but will remain locked and alerting with your contact details.
#### Defend against Phone Porting
One method used by scammers is to trick your phone company into porting (transferring) your mobile phone number to them. Using this, they may be able to reset passwords and gain control of any accounts that rely on your phone number as an authentication device (eg to send you a code to verify it's really you trying to reset your password. If the scammer has your phone number, this could work).

Advice to prevent phone porting
- Set a secure password on your online account for your mobile phone
- keep your details up to date with your mobile phone company
- remove your personal and contact information from your social media and online pages
 - items such as date of birth and phone number will give the scammer information to port your number away
- Your mobile phone company may be able to set a PIN on your account. Remember and protect your PIN.

#### Be alert to SMS scams
SMS scams are where a scammer will send you an SMS message, to trick you into taking some action. The most obvious is smishing where an SMS message encourages you to tap a link in the message, and log in to your account (the system you log into is not genuine, and they will harvest your login and password to scam you. However Smishing could also be a conversation convincing you to buy send money or gift cards, invest money or disclose personal or banking details.

Here is some guidance on how to avoid SMS scams:
- Does the message have a link to tap on? If so, it may be a scam. Be extremely cautious.
- Is this really someone you know or trust? Would they ask you to send money on SMS? Or would they call you and explain?
- A stranger is trying to convince you to send money, Gift Cards, or invest money. Large returns or avoided penalties promised.
- There is pressure to act ASAP to get a benefit or avoid a missed opportunity
